    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>Our group, Axolotl, strives to provide entertainment
      and escapism during these troubling times through the
      usage of a plethora of pet photos provided by Unsplash</p>

    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having
      little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
      shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
      the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating
      the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
      whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
       involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear
      of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an
      upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
      from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
      people’s hats off—then, I account it high time tozz get to sea as soon as
      I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical
      flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.
      There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
      in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
       towards the ocean with me.</p>
